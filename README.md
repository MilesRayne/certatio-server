# Certatio API

This is one half of a browser minigame built in September, 2020 for a mandatory University project.

The repository of the other half, the web application, can be found [here](https://github.com/danielfazlijevic/certatio-front).

At the time this was built both of the authors were very inexperienced programmers, but the project landed us a good grade, and that's all that mattered then.
 
 **If you stumbled upon this page through pinned projects** I'd advise just skipping it. The project being pinned is just an unlucky consequence of most of our current work repositories being private or being on BitBucket - or most likely both.
